                            From the very first glimpse of the house, its sleek modern style is apparent, from the architectural profile down to the style of the house number.  
                            The plantings are low maintenance and properly suited to the hot weather setting in a design by Evergreen Consulting.
                            Designed by Michael Wenrich Architects in collaboration with E2 Custom Homes, the chic residence has an open concept floor plan that uses large windows 
                            to capitalize on its green and private surroundings. The seamless transition from one area to another creates a space that is not only open and beautiful 
                            but also efficient and very functional. Best of all, a lush and tranquil landscape surrounds the house and makes the view from every room relaxing.
                            This minimalist kitchen has everything you could need, most of which is hidden away behind sleek cabinetry. White quartz countertops are highlighted by the 
                            spectacular Cristallo Quartzite backlit backsplash. Top of the line appliances in the kitchen include a Wolf Pro dual range, SubZero refrigerator and freezer, and a room-sized walk-in pantry. Barstools have a low profile and fit under the countertop to maintain a clean look.

                    Designed by Michael Wenrich Architects in collaboration with E2 Custom Homes, the chic residence has an open concept floor plan that uses large windows 
                    to capitalize on its green and private surroundings. The seamless transition from one area to another creates a space that is not only open and beautiful 
                    but also efficient and very functional. Best of all, a lush and tranquil landscape surrounds the house and makes the view from every room relaxing.
                    This minimalist kitchen has everything you could need, most of which is hidden away behind sleek cabinetry. White quartz countertops are highlighted by the 
                    spectacular Cristallo Quartzite backlit backsplash. Top of the line appliances in the kitchen include a Wolf Pro dual range, SubZero refrigerator and freezer, and a room-sized walk-in pantry. Barstools have a low profile and fit under the countertop to maintain a clean look.

                            Nestled among the giant trees, this landscape home is one of the latest modern homes that came off the drawing board of Moscow-based architect Alexandra Fedorova. Characterized by the bureau’s recognizable,
                            award-winning timeless design, this modern forest house celebrates underrated connection of living environment with the nature.
                            While society built cities to offer everything needed for modern living, intact forest environment has its own advantages, the ones that might be even more beneficial for stressful 21st century lifestyle. 
                            Not only living areas are more comfortable during hot summer months, but with trees all around, houses in the forest enjoy more privacy as well. Additionally, dynamic and ever changing face of the nature through seasons turns out to be excellent focal point for interiors, 
                            especially contemporary style ones, characterised with large expanses of glass used as exterior walls.
                            This landscape home perfectly demonstrates this with large sliding glass doors and windows that open out onto the garden and towards the forest. 
                            Furthermore, plenty of outdoor living space surrounding this house in the forest essentially converts forest into a second living room, allowing residents to come home into a truly relaxing and peaceful environment. At the same time, inside, stunning double height dining room with a full-height windows which is designed to create a sense of spaciousness and establish a 
                            dialogue with the forest. What is more, open concept floor plan and elegant minimalist color scheme make interiors bright and airy.
